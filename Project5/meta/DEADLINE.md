## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

### App Category:
API

### Github URL:
`https://github.com/hgri9uewhnfkdm/cs1302-omega`

### Top-level Description:
From user-inputted _describing_ keywords, to a piece of related artwork and a color palette constructed from it, where "describing" means "describing the aesthetic meanings or aspects." This means the returned artworks have been described by the curators of the Art Institute using the inputted keywords, and the keywords do not correspond to the piece's title, author, date, or any such objective metadata.
Has a "NEXT" and "PREVIOUS" buttons to navigate between search results

### Purpose:
For the end user to find inspirational artworks and color palettes that **evoke** or **are associated with** the specified themes or moods, to perhaps to aid the user in creating their own artworks, or for decorating a "mood board" to convey some aesthetic style.

### Motivation:
For the layperson, finding artworks that give off a certain "feeling" is hard, without the background knowledge of artistic movements or terms of technique, etc. 

### APIs Involved:
- [Harvard Art Museums]/"Get objects" (search)
- [IIIF]/"Image API 3.0" (image)
- [Imagga]/"colors" (palette)
- [isEven] (numerical analysis)

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Something new and exciting that i learned from working on this project is Optionals, which is much better than nullables.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If i could start the project over from scratch, i would commit and tag more often, because when i don't, as the features develop, they become "too big to fail," and i end up wasting a lot of time reverting when the feature turned out to not be so great.
